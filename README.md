This is the final project I have completed following Udemy course Web Developer Bootcamp: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/

I have learnt a lot from this course over the summer. I learnt Git, CSS, HTML, jQuery, DOM, Express JS, MongoDB, and Bootstrap library... And a lot about how to structure and plan the files for a large project. And I got to use those skills in my independent project later.
